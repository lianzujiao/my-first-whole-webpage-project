<p>1、No time to delay: China's intangible heritage protection into the reading time</p>
<p>　Intangible cultural heritage is the historical accumulation of ancient civilization and the treasure of Chinese traditional culture. At present, 39 projects, including Peking Opera, traditional Chinese acupuncture, movable type printing and 24 solar terms, have been selected into the UNESCO intangible cultural heritage list, ranking first in the world in total. Since 2006, the state council has named four batches of national intangible cultural heritage, totaling 1327 items, and more intangible cultural heritage at provincial, municipal and county levels. These treasures need us to cherish, protect and inherit.</p>
<p>Inheritors are the carriers and transmitters of intangible cultural heritage, and their skills, experience, cultural memory and teaching ability, as well as the core content and power source of protection and development of intangible cultural heritage. However, many intangible cultural heritage projects are faced with the crisis of "people are skilled in art, while people are dead."</p>
<p>　According to the national library of China memory project center, up to now, the state has published five batches of 3,068 nationally representative inheritors of intangible cultural heritage, of which more than 400 have left us. As zhang qingshan, a researcher at the Chinese academy of arts and director of the committee of experts on the acceptance of rescue records, said, the passing of an inheritor may mean taking away a unique skill and folk activity from the world, which is an irretrievable loss.</p>
