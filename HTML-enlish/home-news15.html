 </p>

In order to facilitate the cultural administration departments at all levels and the public to better understand the relevant contents of the measures, it is hereby interpreted as follows:

</p>
<p>1. Necessity for the formulation of the measures</p>
<p>Making major administrative law enforcement decisions is an important means for administrative law enforcement agencies to fully perform government functions in accordance with the law, which is directly related to the rights and interests of citizens, legal persons and other organizations, as well as the legitimacy of major administrative law enforcement decisions.</p>
<p>Over the years, the cultural administrative departments at all levels in the autonomous region have strictly reviewed major law enforcement decisions and promoted strict and standard fair football law enforcement. However, there are still some problems, mainly: the system of legal review is not comprehensive and systematic; The scope of major law enforcement decisions and the content and procedures of legal review are not clear enough. Therefore, according to the requirements of the central government, referring to the experience of other provinces and combining with the actual situation of our region, it is particularly important and urgent to formulate and promulgate the method of legal review of major administrative law enforcement decisions of guangxi culture.</p>
<p>The main contents of the measures</p>
<p>There are 16 articles in total, mainly including:</p>
<p>(1) definition of legal review of major cultural administrative law enforcement decisions</p>
<p>Administrative law enforcement decides that it is not in line with reality to conduct all legal audit. "Method", therefore, the key is "significant" into the review of legal system of administrative enforcement decision, will be "major administrative enforcement decision legal review" is defined as: culture is major decisions on administrative enforcement decision level of cultural administrative department and the administrative law enforcement agencies in accordance with the law to make major administrative licensing, administrative punishment, administrative mandatory administrative enforcement decisions. The institution of examining the legal system is the legal institution of the cultural administration department. The content of legal audit is the legality, appropriateness and feasibility of major administrative law enforcement decisions.</p>
<p>(2) the circumstances of major administrative law enforcement decisions</p>
<p>In order to facilitate understanding and enhance operability, the measures define major administrative law enforcement decisions in administrative license, administrative punishment and administrative enforcement according to the requirements of administrative license law, administrative punishment law, administrative enforcement law and other laws and regulations, and in combination with the provisions of the rights and responsibilities list of the district. Mainly: 1. 2. Those directly related to the significant rights and interests of the relative person or others in administrative management; 3. Administrative enforcement decisions shall be made through the hearing procedure; 4. The case is complicated and involves multiple legal relationships.</p>
<p>（3) contents of legal audit</p>
<p>In order to guarantee the legality and appropriateness of major administrative law enforcement decisions, we should unify the standards of legal review. The measures stipulate that legal institutions mainly conduct legal review from multiple aspects such as law enforcement subjects, law enforcement personnel, law enforcement authority, identification of facts, application basis, discretion basis, decision contents, law enforcement procedures and law enforcement documents.</p>
<p>(4) procedures for the examination and approval of the legal system</p>
<p>"Procedural justice is the guarantee of substantive justice". The measures stipulate the procedures for the submission of legal audit after the major administrative law enforcement decisions by administrative law enforcement organs and the relevant materials that should be submitted, as well as the examination procedures, time limits and legal documents that should be issued by legal institutions, and regulate the review procedures.</p>
<p>(5) accountability for the legal review</p>
