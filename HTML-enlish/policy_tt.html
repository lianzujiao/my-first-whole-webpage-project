<p>In 1978, under the auspices of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, with the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, China opened the historical process of reform and opening up. From rural to urban, from pilot to promotion, from economic system reform to comprehensive deepening reform, 40 years of success, 40 years of hard work, 40 years of spring and rain, the Chinese people with their hands to write a magnificent epic of national and national development. This epic is full of Chinese power. Xi Jinping pointed out at the 2018 annual meeting of the Boao Forum for Asia: "For 40 years, the Chinese people have always kept pace with the times and have gone forward, fully demonstrating the strength of China."
  Please study along with the "Learning China" series.
</p>
<p>On April 10, 2018, the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference in 2018 opened in Boao, Hainan Province. President Xi Jinping attended the opening ceremony and delivered a keynote speech titled “Opening Together, Creating Innovation, Leading the Future”.

<p>The powerful power of thought. The great Russian writer Tolstoy said: "Ideology is the power to promote the life of oneself and all mankind." Without the liberation of thought, there will be no reform and opening up. Looking back at the historical process of reform and opening up, every important barrier is a conceptual breakthrough and ideological emancipation. In 1978, Comrade Deng Xiaoping led the emancipation of the mind with extraordinary courage and scientific attitude, and broke through various resistances. He clearly supported the "discussion of the issue of truth standards" and broke through the "two things" imprisonment, thus breaking the deadlock of reform.
;In 1992, Comrade Deng Xiaoping actively advocated "do not argue" and ruled out the interference of "surnames of surnames." In his conversation in the South, he pointed out that "the reform and opening up is more courageous, dare to experiment, not like a small-footed woman. If you look at it, you will try it boldly and boldly." It is precisely this time that ideological liberation has successfully eliminated the ideological obstacles on the road of reform and opening up, so that China's economic and social development has continuously gained new vitality and momentum, and created a good situation for China's long-term economic and social rapid and sustainable development.It is precisely by persisting in emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts that China can complete the great historical transformation from a highly centralized planned economic system to a dynamic socialist market economic system and from a closed semi-closed state to an all-round opening. Practice has proved that without emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts, there will be no breakthroughs in reform or openness, and it will be difficult to push forward the cause of reform and opening up. The Third Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee pointed out: "The development of practice will never end, the emancipation of the mind will never end, and the reform and opening up will never end." Today, 40 years later, under the leadership of Xi Jinping’s new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics, the party and The country's cause has opened up a new situation in an all-round way, solved many problems that have been solved for a long time and have not been solved. It has become a major event that has been done in the past and has not been completed. It has achieved all-round pioneering achievements and carried out profound fundamentals. Change has opened a new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Xi Jinping pointed out: "The Chinese people persist in emancipating the mind, seeking truth from facts, realizing the emancipation of the mind and the mutual agitation of reform and opening up, the promotion of ideas and the exploration of practice, fully demonstrating the powerful forces led by thought."
