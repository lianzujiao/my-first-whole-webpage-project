<p>"To pass on their skills to the next generation is to find more money." Records China council deputy secretary general xiao long said. In the past, many folk arts strictly adhered to the "inheritors' training" such as "inheritors' training", such as "inheritors' training" and "inheritors' training", such as "inheritors' training" and "inheritors' training". "In today's social environment, it is increasingly rare for children who are willing to devote themselves to learning from teachers and have artistic savvy, so they break the walls of family inheritance mode and expand social influence, becoming the choice of the older generation to inherit the family." Yang jiannin, who has recently become the fifth batch of national representative inheritors, said with emotion.</p>
<p>"I brought five or six apprentices with me, and I can't count the ones who are not. I attend the intangible cultural heritage campus every year." Qin mengyu, an 80-year-old representative national intangible heritage project inheritor of yangko in changli, proudly told reporters. Many national representative inheritors of intangible cultural heritage who participated in the rescue record project are still actively cooperating with the rescue record shooting to promote the inheritance of the living state of intangible cultural heritage despite their age.</p>
<p>Liu kuoli, a famous Chinese scholar of intangible cultural heritage protection and a member of the honorary department of the Chinese academy of social sciences, believes that when they become representative inheritors, they have already consciously identified the historical and cultural value of the intangible cultural heritage project, and took the initiative to assume the responsibility of "guarding god" for this cultural event.</p>
<p>"Not only to write it down, but to use it." Zhang qingshan believes that the work of rescue records should not only be documented and preserved, but also be used to accumulate data for follow-up research and provide support for the promotion and revitalization of intangible cultural heritage.</p>
<p>From the perspective of project results, there are not only oral films and practical films that comprehensively present intangible cultural heritage projects, but also teaching films suitable for reference learning and overview films for mass communication. "Some inheritors' teaching ability is very strong and infectious, and a 45-minute teaching film provides' video textbook 'for intangible inheritance." Tian Miao said.</p>
<p>This acceptance inspection, guizhou and henan were rated as the most excellent projects, with 3 each. Lu yongchang, deputy director of the intangible cultural heritage protection center of guizhou province, told reporters that guizhou province has begun to try in the development and promotion of intangible cultural heritage records. "In the culture and tourism under the overall deployment of the department of intangible, we prepare and guizhou television to discuss this part what record achievement promotion, also plans to hold documentary promotion seminar, invites teachers in colleges and universities, the media platform, to better promote the heritage project, the goal is to make more people pay attention to and understand and love our intangible items." "Lu said.</p>
<p>Art is long, and age is fleeting. We hope that our rescue record can arouse people's sense of urgency for the protection of intangible cultural heritage and work together to make the protection of intangible cultural heritage more in-depth and solid, live up to the mission of The Times and be worthy of the protection of ancestors and descendants. "Zhang qingshan said.</p>
