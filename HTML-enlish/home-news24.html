Talking about the future teaching of "apprentices", zhang said that when she saw them sitting quietly in class, she seemed to see a number of excellent inheritors of the art of embroidery in the future.</p>
 <p>In the worship ceremony, the apprentice presented the teacher with the attachment, the gift of the teacher, the grand ceremony of kneeling and the tea, and the master presented the apprentice with the certificate. The apprentice made requirements and expectations, and the process was full of solemn and solemn ceremony feeling.</p>
