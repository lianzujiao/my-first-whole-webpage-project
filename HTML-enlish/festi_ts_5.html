<p>Regarding the source of the Harbin Festival, there are many beautiful legends in the Three Islands of the Jing. The more influential is the commemoration of the song singer and the legend of Zhenhai King.
</p>
<p>Before the holiday, the women in the family are arranged in the order of the second room of the long house. Collect the bamboo tube, the bucket and the samba leaves and the dried bracken in the river. Go home and mix with glutinous rice, sorghum and salt, and marinate in the altar. Spare, and use the "new water" that has just been taken from the well to make liqueur. The festival dishes are mainly fish, and they also need to eat corn and melon without salt. This is "reminiscent of bitterness." In the old festival etiquette, on the square table next to the fire pit, there were utensils filled with glutinous rice. The rice was covered with four bones and the leaves were placed on the table. A bench was placed at the table, and several bones were placed on each bench at a certain distance. Danye, glutinous rice on the leaves and three uncut ears, four fish, two bowls of boiled melon, two bowls of liqueur and dried bracken mixed with pickles, next to a pair of solid bamboo New chopsticks. After the placement is completed, the oldest ones will taste a variety of meals, and then the houses will be eaten in a long order.

</p>
<p>The legend of Zhenhai King is the most widely spread.

　　
</p>
<p>According to legend, in the Bailong Sea, there are only a lot of people who have eaten. If the passing vessel does not send the individual to eat it, it will make waves and turn over the vessel. One day, there was a fairy god, and the boat sailed across the sea. The boat drove to the mouth of the Jingjing Cave. When the boat pushed the dragonfly down to the sea, the old man stuffed the big pumpkin that had been boiled beforehand into the mouth of the Jingjing. Under the big pumpkin, it is hot and straight, and the corpse is broken into three small islands. The head is called Wutou Island, the middle one is called Shanxin Island, and the tail is called Wanwei Island. Therefore, people changed the gods to the "Zhenhai King" and built the Harting Pavilion for worship, which is passed down to the present year.
