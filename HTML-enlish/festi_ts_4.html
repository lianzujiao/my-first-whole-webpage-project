<p>Eating a new festival is an ancient traditional festival of the Yi people. Prevailing in the vast township. The new time and rituals vary from place to place. The Yi villages in Tianzhu, Jinping, Sansui and other counties in Guizhou, some on the first day after the summer heat, and some held a new ceremony on the "寅" or "卯" day in July.
</p>
<p>Before the holiday, the women in the family are arranged in the order of the second room of the long house. Collect the bamboo tube, the bucket and the samba leaves and the dried bracken in the river. Go home and mix with glutinous rice, sorghum and salt, and marinate in the altar. Spare, and use the "new water" that has just been taken from the well to make liqueur. The festival dishes are mainly fish, and they also need to eat corn and melon without salt. This is "reminiscent of bitterness." In the old festival etiquette, on the square table next to the fire pit, there were utensils filled with glutinous rice. The rice was covered with four bones and the leaves were placed on the table. A bench was placed at the table, and several bones were placed on each bench at a certain distance. Danye, glutinous rice on the leaves and three uncut ears, four fish, two bowls of boiled melon, two bowls of liqueur and dried bracken mixed with pickles, next to a pair of solid bamboo New chopsticks. After the placement is completed, the oldest ones will taste a variety of meals, and then the houses will be eaten in a long order.

</p>
<p>At noon, the reeds of each village circled into a circle, blowing up the cheerful and melodious reeds. The girl and the young man danced around the reeds and performed “stepping on the temple”. Sometimes thousands of people participated in singing and dancing. When fighting horses, one person first took a mare to the middle of the racecourse, and then brought two strong stallions from both sides. When the horse was about to pass by the mare, the two stallions each hugged their heads and raised their front hooves. Hey, rushing to the other side and fighting, or biting or kicking, sometimes erect both, sometimes chasing quickly, the scene is very intense and intense, and some have to fight dozens of rounds before winning, the loser withdraws, the winner again Fighting another new stallion. Finally, people rushed to congratulate the winning horsemen.
</p>
<p> At the end of the fighting horse, the reed race entered a climax, and the villages used all the skills to show the playing skills. The judges who listened to the slopes judged the winners. Finally, the reed team who participated in the slope meeting ensemble together, and suddenly the mountain sounded in the valley, and it resounded through the sky.

<p>The Yi people eat a new festival, and worshipping the ancestors is an important part. This morning, I have eaten the new festival's stockade, killing pigs and slaughtering cattle, killing chickens and killing ducks, fishing in the fields, and steaming rice in the house. Before the meal, the whole family was sitting around the fire pit and was held by the parents. The "Fighting Sisters" ceremony is to place three sheets of paper money on the front of the stove, three wine glasses, and put three points of cooked glutinous rice, pork, chicken, and fish on paper money, and then burn the fragrant paper. , divide the burnt fragrant paper into 3
 Each is inserted in the fire pond and on the shrine; while reading the "Ancestral Auspicious Words", the meaning is: "Respected ancestors, today is the auspicious day, our family has eaten a new festival, and has prepared wine, pork, fish and glutinous rice. Please come first, let us taste it later. You grow up and we grow up. Our younger generation calls you, and after hearing the shouts, you have to invite each other and tell each other, the young and the old will come, come to us together. I am going to bless our family's well-being, and the people are prosperous, wealthy and wealthy, rich and rich like Qian Niang and Ba Mei, like Xue Rengui, who is like a baggage; bless us to grow grain, grow cotton into a ball, and harvest grain. Six animals are prosperous, millennial generations, the more you eat, the richer and the richer." The ancestral verses are long and short. After finishing the ancestral rituals, put 3 glasses of wine in the respect, first pour a cup of milk into the burnt paper money, and take two cups for the people present. 3 grain collections used by Jingzu
  When you put it in a warehouse, it means that the rice is full of warehouses, and one is placed on the fire. I wish you a full moon, a tree in the jar, symbolizing the salted fish and the bacon. Then the whole family is united to face one side, usually turning to the east and wishing for it, so that you can have a meal. Why do you want to unite to one side?
?The old man, there is a saying that if the whole family turns east and west before eating, the rice in the field will be messed up this year, which will reduce production and unfavorable harvest. Unity faces one side, and everything goes smoothly.
</p>
<P>The Yi people eat new festivals, in addition to the ancestral prayers and harvests, but also carry out a variety of recreational activities. Generally speaking, it is more common in the form of bullfighting, fighting birds, and deductive dramas. Most of the Yi people live in the mountains, and bullfighting is one of their favorite activities. In the folk songs of "The Bullfighting Ancient Words", I wrote: "The hole will call for entertainment, and the seedlings and ancestors will buy silver in the first place, bragging the bullfighting, and forget to return." On the day of the new festival, people dressed in nationalities Dressed up, especially the girls dressed very beautifully, they wear their own new clothes embroidered with their own hands; the young men dressed in green cloth, the whole village of men and women came to beat Niu Ping, watching bullfighting activities. I saw the bullring, the crowds, very lively. After the bullfighting, the main Zhai people invited their relatives to their own guests. At the banquet, talk about bullfighting and exchange production experience, and pass on information; while eating and drinking, guessing and ordering, toasting each other and respecting meat, some guessing and drinking until late at night. The Yi people eat a new festival, which is both a material exchange activity and a broad spiritual civilization activity. The Yi people are very hospitable, and there is a saying that "people don't leave, and bridges don't go bad."
