<p>1. Why does the National Art Fund set up an art talent training funded project?
</p>
<p>Studying and implementing the requirements of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China on "strengthening the construction of the team and creating a large number of famous masters of German art and art", implementing the spirit of the inaugural General Secretary of the General Secretary of the General Assembly on the work of the series of literary and artistic work, the actual construction of the art fund from the art talent team in China Starting from the situation, with the goal of improving artistic accomplishment and improving professional competence, the art talent training program was designed to guide, encourage and support art units and institutions to improve the quality of training, cultivate high-quality professionals, prosper socialist literature and art, and promote the creative development of art. .
 
</p>
<p>2. What is the scope of funding for the Art Talents Development Project?
 </p>
<p>The scope of funding for the Art Talents Training Program includes: art professionals, management talents, and theoretical reviewers in the fields of stage art, fine arts, calligraphy, photography, arts and crafts, and online literature (network performance, online music), covering the current art activities. The main areas of the art work are related to the creation, production, marketing and evaluation of art works.
 </p>
<p> 3. What are the funding priorities for the Art Talents Funding Program?
</p>
<p>Taking Xi Jinping's new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics as a guide to action and implementing the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, this year's key funding will focus on commemorating the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up, celebrating the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, building a well-off society in an all-round way and celebrating the founding of the Communist Party A creative talent training program carried out at important time points such as the anniversary; a project to support the real-life creative talents of the Yingge Party, the Yingge Motherland, the Yingge People, and the Yangge Heroes; appropriately increase the drama, art, puppet, shadow and national music, national opera Funding for the cultivation of national art forms and network literature and art talents.
 </p>
<p>Different from the academic education and socialized art training of colleges and universities, the art talents training project funded by the Art Fund follows the art professionals, compound management talents and theoretical commentary talents who are in small batches, high-level and urgently needed. The object project reflects the characteristics of “famous teacher”, paying attention to the improvement of special artistic skills, the expansion of professional vision, the teaching of individualized artistic experience and the deep integration of teaching and practice.
 </p>
<p>4. How is the recommended range of the art talent training funded project determined? Can you declare the training project outside the recommended range?
</p>
<p>The scope of recommendation is the further refinement of the focus of the art fund's funding for the art talent training project. It is determined by the shortage of talents in key areas and key links in light of the current and long-term development needs of China's art industry. Judging from the project declaration and evaluation of the Art Fund for more than four years, the areas where the national art talent gap is relatively large are mainly concentrated in four aspects: First, the key links and weak links of artistic creation, such as the classic repertoire of young performers. Drama writers, stage art performers, symphony and national orchestral composition, commanding talents, etc.; second, creative design talents in emerging art categories, such as historical and cultural villages, famous towns and characteristic towns, creative design talents, animation, games, The creative design talents of the new media art; the third is to meet the urgent needs of the development of the art industry, such as art management management talents, art theory criticism talents; fourth, network literature and art talents, such as online literature and creative talents, art and technology innovation talents. These areas are also the main content of the recommended range. The Art Fund encourages and welcomes the applicants to declare art talent training projects outside the recommended scope according to their actual conditions and resource advantages, and will treat them equally at the time of the judging. When designing the application project, the instinct should be small, the content should be realistic, the expansion should be deep, the generalization should be avoided, and the lack of pertinence and goal should be sloppy.
 </p>
<p>5. How is the amount of funding for the art talent training funded project determined?
 </p>
<p>On the basis of extensive research, the Art Fund has held expert demonstration meetings and listened to the opinions of cultural administrative departments at various levels and various art units and institutions. After repeated calculations, it has formulated a plan for funding quotas for art talent training projects. The program divides the amount of funding into different grades according to factors such as art category, country (outside and outside the country), number of students, duration of lectures, and enrollment targets. For the project funded through the expert review, the Art Fund will re-approve the budget for the project implementation plan and budget plan according to the above-mentioned relevant indicators, and organize financial experts to demonstrate the funding. This is also the reason why the reporting entity needs to re-fill the budget when signing the “funded project agreement”.
</p>
<p>......</p>
<p>When the project is completed and accepted, the project entity shall submit the project implementation report, the “Conclusion Checklist”, the third-party audit report of the project fund, the teaching results, and the media evaluation as required. The art talent training funded project covers the cultivation of talents in creation, performance, design, and theory. Therefore, the forms of teaching results submitted are not the same. The main body of the project may refer to the “Measures for the Acceptance of Art Talents Funding Projects” issued by the Supervision Department of the Art Fund Management Center to prepare the final acceptance materials.
