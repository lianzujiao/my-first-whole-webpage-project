 <p>"Inflammatory Dragon Dance" is circulated in Liangqing Township, Liangqing District, Nanning City. It is a mixed area between Zhuang and Han. It is named "Cylinder Village" because residents are good at making pottery. Popular in the "Inflammatory Dragon Dance", the legend of the artist has a history of more than three hundred years. During the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, the residents here used bamboo rafts and tree stalks to tie the skeleton of Jackie Chan, wrapped in cactus, tiger lemon (a wild plant), and the whole dragon was divided into a dragon head and a dragon festival (9 knots or 11 Section), the three parts of the dragon tail, when the dragon dances, the scent is ignited on the faucet, the dragon body and the dragon tail, and the knot is connected with a straw rope. The total length of the dragon is about 17 meters. Thirteen to fifteen people are required (two of them substitute dance faucets and dragon tails). In addition, there are one person in the Dragon Ball, five in the Palm Dragon, four to five percussion, a fish lamp, a shrimp lamp, a crab lamp, a monkey lamp, a rabbit lamp and so on.

<p>On the occasion of the Mid-Autumn Festival in the lunar calendar in August, on the evening of the 14th, 15th and 16th, the "Flaming Dragon Dance" was performed in the four neighboring villages, and it was called "Fire Dragon Tour Town". Legend has it that in the Liangqing area of ​​Suining County, residents have burned ceramics here for generations. One year, the plague became popular and many people died. Later, the "three holy public" appeared spirit (three holy public refers to Emperor Wendi, Xuan Emperor, Guandi), and a fire dragon drove away the plague and saved the local people. Therefore, people set up a "three holy public" temple. The incense is continually throughout the year, and around the Mid-Autumn Festival, the fire dragon sacrifices
 At that time, the peasants will make voluntary donations to build dragons, and insert a row of incense and fire dragon dance. When you travel through each household, the head of the household will go out and put fireworks and firecrackers to welcome it, and fight for the high-quality incense to replace the incense dragon, and then take three "faucet incense" at the faucet, which is considered auspicious Go home to sacrifice ancestors. Along with Xianghuolong, there are several porters who carry a few barrels of "fire dragon tea". Long tea is over, and both men, women and children are rushing to grab a drink. They think that drinking dragon tea will not get sick for a year, and they will not grow old. In addition, in front of the incense dragon, there is a large row of lights on the side of the book "Fire Dragon Tour, Burning Glory" and four small lamps with the words "Five Grains, Six Animals Prosperous". At this time, a piece of fireworks and firecrackers, the flares are shining, such as the dragon clouds, very spectacular.
After the dragon's activities, the dragon dragon's artist threw the incense dragon into the Lijiang River to show the dragon to the sea. Before throwing the "Fire Dragon" into the river, the masses rushed to cut off a section of "Dragons" (the rope that connects the dragon body), and thought that the collection of "Dragons" in the home could guarantee the prosperity of people and animals in one year.
