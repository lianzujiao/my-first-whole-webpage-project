<p>阎红霞为Guangxi's emphasis on the cultivation and selection of young dancers is touched by their dedication. But she also points to existing problems and raises higher expectations. "The basic skills of the actors are not solid enough," she said. Many actors ignore facial expressions and indulge themselves too much without communicating with the audience. What is the connotation of the works and characters they want to convey? These things are lacking."
</p>

<p>According to gu liangliang, a dancer by birth, the contest's works are rich in diversity, with all kinds of dances on display, from minority dances to classical dances to modern dances. What is surprising is that some dancers in guangxi have outstanding performance and personal art style. They are very bright and mature and can play the leading role in some large-scale performance activities. Gu liangliang hopes: "it is to show individuality on the stage. It is really important for each contestant to choose a piece of work. If they choose a piece that suits them, they will get twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>Wang summed up five games vividly: the first, the wind was light, the second, the third, the fourth, and the fifth. He said, "I have five criteria to judge an actor. One is to watch a play, two people, three technical skills, four stylistic rhythm, rhythm and five integrity. You take five dimensions to judge whether you are in place or not. It is suggested that more ethnic and folk works featuring guangxi be introduced in the future.</p>
<p>During the event, the organizing committee also organized the participating programs to perform cultural benefit to the people, celebrating the 40th anniversary of the reform and opening-up and the 60th anniversary of the autonomous region, and sharing the new achievements of guangxi's cultural reform and development. At the same time, it also introduces the contract system of dance creation project, gives the key support to the selected dance creation project, and launches a batch of dancing fine works of GUI feng zhuangyun. The reporter understands that from now on, the department of culture of the autonomous region has paid close attention to and supported relevant supporting projects and performing activities, and encouraged people to go deep into life and create dance works with profound thoughts, exquisite art and excellent production. During the activity, "2017 guangxi dancing works creation signing project acceptance" was performed, and ten programs were presented in turn, including "playing with the miao girls", "moon sea", "hometown" and "rain falling flowers".</p>
