<p>"March 3" is the biggest singer day in the Zhuang area, also known as the "Greek Festival". According to legend, it is a folk commemorative festival formed to commemorate Liu Sanjie. In 1984, the People's Government of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region officially designated this day as a national festival for the Zhuang people - the "March 3" Song Festival. On this day of the year, a grand festival is held in Nanning, the capital of the autonomous region, and other places. During the festival, in addition to the traditional singing activities, there are also a variety of cultural and sports activities such as robbing fireworks, throwing hydrangea, touching eggs and performing dramas, dancing dragons, playing cymbals, showing movies, performing martial arts and acrobatics. . In addition, various commercial trade, investment negotiations and other activities have gradually increased, forming a new trend of "culture set up, economic singing". At that time, Lingnan Zhuang Township will gather in the four seas, and the song will be like the sea. The singer of the song, which is endless, evokes people’s thoughts and enthusiasm for the harvest, love, and happiness.
</p>
<p>It is rumored that Liu Sanjie was a farmer of the Zhuang nationality in the Tang Dynasty. She was young and intelligent and was regarded as a "goddess." At the age of twelve, I can pass the biography, and I will sing songs and open my mouth. Self-singing and singing, the song is like a spring, beautiful and moving, without losing the temperament, so it has the reputation of "song". At the age of fifteen, he was employed by Lin, and in the tenth year of Tang Kaiyuan (722), in order to resist Lin’s forced marriage, he and his lover Zhang Wei looked forward and did not know what to do. The folks think that they both go to immortality. The legend of Yishan Zhuang in Guangxi, Liu Sanjie was born in the first year of Tang Zhongzong Shenlong (703 years), from childhood to wisdom, can sing and sing. At the age of 12, he was exported to a chapter, and the whispered words were sung in the songs. After that, I went to the nearby places to sing songs. The admiration came to her with the songs of the people, but the short one day, the long three or five days, all screaming, no songs relative, no words to answer, shy and retreat. However, her talent was hated by rogue bullies, and she was later killed in Liuzhou. Legend has it that after she died, riding a squid became a fairy. Some also said that she was in the seven mountains of the Xishan and Baihe teenagers in Guixian. There is also a saying that the rich man Mo Huairen wants to marry her, the third sister resolutely resists, Mo bought the government to persecute the third sister, the third sister floated by boat, and so on.
</p>
<p>On this day of the festival, every household made five-colored risotto, dyed colored eggs, and celebrated the festival. The song festival usually lasts for two or three days, and the place is in the open space not far from the village. The bamboo and cloth are used as a singer to receive the foreign village singer. The song is based on unmarried young men and women, but the elderly and children are coming to watch. The small songs are one or two thousand, and the big songs can reach tens of thousands. Next to the songs, vendors gather and the people's trade is active. The nearby people provide food for those who come to sing praises, whether they know each other or not, they are warmly received. A large song, the young men and women who have been in the tens of miles are coming to participate, and the songs are crowded and the songs come and go. The Pangang River in Bama, the cotton mountain in Duan, the Qiaoye in Tianyang, the Xia in Yishan, and the Yufeng Mountain in Liuzhou are all historically large songs. People go to the songs to play songs and enjoy songs; young men and women pass the songs, and if the two sides love each other, they will give each other a token and think of it.
